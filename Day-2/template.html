    <p>“You Are Now Breathing Manually…”</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When someone tells you this, your initial reaction is to likely try to
      fight the urge to think about your breath, and soon you’ll realize that
      the more effort you put in to fight it i.e. the more you try to not think
      about thinking about your breath, the more you’re unlikely to be
      successful in doing so. It’s only by completely letting go, giving up your
      sense of control of the breath, that you’re able to get it to return to
      its natural rhythm and fade into the background of your mind.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      One of the funny things about the mind is that it doesn’t like being told
      what to do, despite it being the one telling it what to do.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      For the past 4 months (starting last December), I’ve been exploring this
      idea and the inner processes of my own mind through daily meditation. This
      practice initially started as an attempt to try to calm my own mind from
      the sporadic thoughts that tended to cloud my daily life, but has since
      developed into a daily routine that provides me so much joy and has helped
      build my ability to feel compassion and empathy toward others, and
      ultimately learn how to live more intentionally.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This term “meditation” gets thrown around a lot but it’s really just a
      fancy word for “focused awareness of what’s happening right now”. The idea
      around meditation is that by focusing your mind on what’s happening right
      now, your mind will become clearer and calmer.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If I may entertain you for a few minutes more, I’m going to reflect and
      share with you a few things that I’ve learned and observed through this
      practice so far.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Be aware.</h2>
    <p>
      Before I started this practice, meditation to me was a foreign idea,
      something I thought only monks did, or certainly wasn’t for a “regular”
      person like myself. I also thought meditation was extremely difficult to
      do, and even if I could convince myself to try to do it, I figured it
      would require considerable practice to really get started. I’ll show you
      right now why all of these preconceptions were wrong.
    </p>
    <h3>Breathe.</h3>
    <p>
      No seriously, breathe right now. As you breathe in, feel it in your chest
      as your lungs fill with air. Focus on that feeling, letting everything
      else fade into the background. Don’t judge that feeling, just be aware of
      it. Now breathe out, continuing to hold onto that feeling. Breathe again,
      continuing to hold that focus. If your mind wanders, acknowledge the
      passing thought, and bring your focus back to the breath. Rinse & repeat.
    </p>
    <br />
    <span>Congrats, you just ~meditated~</span>
    <br />
    <p>
      Everything else you may hear about meditation these days: meditation
      pillows, meditation apps, mantras & sound bites, are only there to try to
      help you create an environment that is conducive to being able to sustain
      that focused awareness. At the end of the day, no matter what you do to
      create that mental space for yourself, don’t lose track of the real
      purpose of meditation: to simply be aware.
    </p>
    <br />
    <span>Which leads into the next thing I’ve learned…</span>
    <br />
    <h2>Be awake.</h2>
    <p>
      Through the 4 months of logging my daily meditation experiences, one of
      the trends I noticed more than anything else was that the easiest way to
      make meditation more difficult and less effective for myself was to try to
      do it when I’m sleepy. This isn’t to say it’s impossible, but it certainly
      makes it more challenging, like trying to go to the gym in a state of
      physical exhaustion.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I typically do anywhere from 10–30 minutes of meditation per day (you can
      do as little or as much as you like), but even that small amount of time
      can seem like an eternity to your mind when you’re tired.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      One of the most effective ways that I’ve found to combat the possibility
      of falling asleep and to increase my awareness is to meditate right in the
      morning, after a shower & a cup of joe. At that point, you should be awake
      enough that you aren’t going to fall back asleep but it’s still early
      enough in the day that you can approach that time with a fresh, clean
      slate of curiosity.
    </p>
    <span>Which leads me into my third observation…</span>
    <br />
    <h2>Be curious.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Don’t take meditation too seriously. Meditation is just about being aware
      of what’s going on around you, so have fun with it and be curious about
      what you’ll find. Try not to think of meditation as something that is
      separate from your everyday life. Recognize that when you’re meditating,
      you’re living as fully as ever.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When thoughts inevitably pop up during your meditation practice, be
      curious about what they are, observe them and acknowledge them, but then
      let them go.
    </p>
    <br />
    <span>All in all, be sure to have fun, and…</span>
    <br />
    <h2>Be deliberate.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you’re going to meditate (as you should), don’t half-ass it. Be
      deliberate in what you want to achieve. Try your best in your meditation
      to bring your full energy and focus into that awareness, but recognize
      when your mind fails on that promise and find the capacity to admit it,
      forgive yourself, and try again.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The best things in life are usually those worth working for. Meditation is
      something you need to practice, but its rewards are worth the effort. By
      being deliberate, you can be sure that you are focusing your energy in the
      most effective way.
    </p>
    <br />
    <span> ... </span>
    <br />
    <p>
      I hope these few reflections help provide you with a bit of insight into
      what meditation is, and how you can get the most out of your practice. As
      you may note, the above musings could be applied to not only meditation
      but also to life in general. This shouldn’t really come as too big of a
      surprise given how meditation is simply living with more intentional
      awareness.
    </p>
    <span
      >So go out there, and enjoy each breath. Happy meditating, happy living
      :)</span
